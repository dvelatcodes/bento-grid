# Bento grid

The challenge is to build out this bento grid and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

### Expected behaviour

The two components in the left column on desktop are placed at the bottom on mobile. This is a good opportunity to practice your CSS Grid placement skills.
